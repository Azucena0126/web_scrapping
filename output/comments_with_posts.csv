1nok4av,"As [Donald Trump](https://inews.co.uk/topic/donald-trump?ico=in-line_link) hailed “the golden age of America” at the UN General Assembly in New York on Tuesday, tensions between the US and United Nations were palpable.

[The President](https://inews.co.uk/news/science/what-science-says-autism-why-trump-wrong-3932354?ico=in-line_link) highlighted “historic trade deals” with the UK and others, and claimed the US was respected “like it has never been respected before” – but the response was embarrassing.

There was [scattered awkward laughter in the room](https://inews.co.uk/news/politics/uk-politics-latest-updates-live-5-3930091?ico=in-line_link) as he jokingly complained about a broken escalator and teleprompter at the UN – and a lack of marble floors. UN officials and experts have warned that Trump’s combative approach to the organisation could lead to a waning of US influence.

Since the start of the year, Trump has moved to slash US funding of the UN, withdrawn from many of its agencies, and ordered a review of America’s interactions with the organisation.

His actions have exacerbated the UN’s already significant budget crisis and created space for nations including China to expand their influence.

“US credibility and influence as a reliable partner and as a state broadly committed to human rights and international peace and security is suffering badly,” Phil Lynch, executive director of the non-profit International Service for Human Rights, told *The i Paper*.

“Trump on the international level has an agenda which very much mirrors his agenda at the domestic level, which is one of the suppression of dissent, the erosion of accountability mechanisms and the subversion of the rule of law.

“His agenda at the UN in terms of the withdrawal of funding and denunciation of treaties follows a very similar pattern.”",2219,politics,Trump's big UN speech received with awkward laughter in embarrassing backfire,https://inews.co.uk/news/world/trumps-big-un-speech-received-with-awkward-laughter-in-embarrassing-backfire-3933958,26152,1641

1nonj9g,"Thank you AOC! Also, some words of wisdom from a Christ-like figure who wants the best for everyone in America:

- “There is no separation of church and state. It’s a fabrication, it’s a fiction, it’s not in the constitution. It’s made up by secular humanists.” – The Charlie Kirk Show, Jul 6, 2022  
  *Context: Kirk dismissed the constitutional principle of church–state separation, framing it as an invention of secular humanists.*  

- “If you’re a WNBA, pot-smoking, Black lesbian, do you get treated better than a United States marine?” – The Charlie Kirk Show, Dec 8, 2022  
  *Context: He mocked Brittney Griner’s release from Russian custody, contrasting her with U.S. military personnel.*  

- “I think it’s worth it to have a cost of, unfortunately, some gun deaths every single year so that we can have the second amendment to protect our other God-given rights. That is a prudent deal. It is rational.” – TPUSA Faith event, Apr 5, 2023  
  *Context: At a Turning Point USA Faith event, he argued that recurring gun deaths are an acceptable trade-off to preserve Second Amendment rights.*  

- “Happening all the time in urban America, prowling Blacks go around for fun to go target white people, that’s a fact. It’s happening more and more.” – The Charlie Kirk Show, May 19, 2023  
  *Context: Kirk described Black people as predatory and violent, pushing a racist stereotype about interracial crime.*  

- “If we would have said that Joy Reid and Michelle Obama and Sheila Jackson Lee and Ketanji Brown Jackson were affirmative action picks, we would have been called racists. Now they’re coming out and they’re saying it for us … You do not have the brain processing power to otherwise be taken really seriously. You had to go steal a white person’s slot to go be taken somewhat seriously.” – The Charlie Kirk Show, Jul 13, 2023  
  *Context: He attacked Black women leaders, claiming they only advanced due to affirmative action and lacked intellectual ability.*  

- “If I’m dealing with somebody in customer service who’s a moronic Black woman, I wonder is she there because of her excellence, or is she there because of affirmative action?” – The Charlie Kirk Show, Jan 3, 2024  
  *Context: Kirk questioned whether a Black woman in customer service was competent, or just a token hire under affirmative action.*  

- “If I see a Black pilot, I’m going to be like, boy, I hope he’s qualified.” – The Charlie Kirk Show, Jan 23, 2024  
  *Context: He implied Black professionals, including pilots, are suspect hires whose competence should be doubted.*  

- “The great replacement strategy, which is well under way every single day in our southern border, is a strategy to replace white rural America with something different.” – The Charlie Kirk Show, Mar 1, 2024  
  *Context: Kirk invoked the white nationalist “Great Replacement” conspiracy, claiming immigration is designed to displace white Americans.*  

- “The American Democrat party hates this country. They wanna see it collapse. They love it when America becomes less white.” – The Charlie Kirk Show, Mar 20, 2024  
  *Context: He accused Democrats of deliberately pushing demographic change to weaken America and reduce its white population.*  

- “We need to have a Nuremberg-style trial for every gender-affirming clinic doctor. We need it immediately.” – The Charlie Kirk Show, Apr 1, 2024  
  *Context: He compared gender-affirming care to war crimes, calling for doctors to face trials modeled on Nazi prosecutions.*  

- “The answer is yes, the baby would be delivered.” – Surrounded debate show, Sep 8, 2024  
  *Context: Asked if he would allow his 10-year-old daughter to have an abortion if raped, Kirk replied no — the child would be forced to give birth.*  

- “America has freedom of religion, of course, but we should be frank: large dedicated Islamic areas are a threat to America.” – The Charlie Kirk Show, Apr 30, 2025  
  *Context: He framed Muslim communities as inherently dangerous, arguing they pose a national security threat.*  

- “We’ve been warning about the rise of Islam on the show, to great amount of backlash. We don’t care, that’s what we do here. And we said that Islam is not compatible with western civilization.” – The Charlie Kirk Show, Jun 24, 2025  
  *Context: Kirk declared Islam fundamentally incompatible with Western values and civilization.*  

- “America was at its peak when we halted immigration for 40 years and we dropped our foreign-born percentage to its lowest level ever. We should be unafraid to do that.” – The Charlie Kirk Show, Aug 22, 2025  
  *Context: He praised the early 20th-century era of immigration restriction and advocated for shutting down immigration again.*  

- “Reject feminism. Submit to your husband, Taylor. You’re not in charge.” – The Charlie Kirk Show, Aug 26, 2025  
  *Context: In response to news of Taylor Swift’s engagement to Travis Kelce, he told her to abandon feminism and obey her husband.*

1nnpbbf,"American Jews as a demographic are mostly Ashkenazim, meaning their families came to the US from Eastern European countries. Jews in America have largely been a part of the Democratic coalition since the New Deal. Prominent left-wing Israeli politicians like Ben Gurion and Golda Meir were also Ashkenazi and coming from socialist countries in the USSR may have influenced that. American Jews are also highly educated (which correlates with voting left-wing in the US) and are concentrated in states like blue states like New York, Illinois, and California, and purple states like Arizona, Pennsylvania, and Florida.

The majority of Israeli Jews are Mizrahi, which means their family came to Israel from Middle Eastern/Arab countries (or have lived in Israel for several generations). These voters, who experienced living in Arab countries are much more security minded and have experienced/heard stories of the persecution of Jews in Arab lands. One of the reasons that Israel went from having socialist leadership early on like Ben Gurion and Golda Meir, to conservative leadership like Sharon and Netanyahu is that Israel's early immigrants were Ashkenazi and over decades the country grew from Jewish immigrants being kicked out of Muslim countries like Yemen, Iraq, Morroco and migrating to Israel.

Trump is popular in Israel because he is viewed as being unapologetically pro-Israel and pro-Israeli security. He recognized Israeli annexation of the Golan, moved the US embassy to Jerusalem (de-facto recognizing it as Israel's capitol), and has been supportive of the war against Hamas in Gaza (for example Trump negotiated directly with Hamas on the release of an American Israeli captive Edan Alexander). Jews in Israel, receive the benefits of Trump's foreign policy without having to endure his Domestic policy. American Jews are socially liberal, and while many are supportive of Israel, they are more affected by Domestic US policy and vote left for social/economic reasons (abortion is overwhelmingly accepted in Judaism for example).",414,PoliticalDiscussion,"Why are American conservatives (Trump) so popular in Israel, whereas American Jews are predominantly Democrat?",https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/1nnpbbf/why_are_american_conservatives_trump_so_popular/,299,145

1nnpbbf,"The American Evangelican Christian Right has promoted Israel since the 1970s. The Modern Evangelical Movement is highly Millennialist meaning that its very apocalyptic in a very immediate sense. This strain of Christianity stresses that the end times are going to happen any time now, or that they've already begun and we are now living through their opening stages. This idea creates an immediacy to their faith, that they must get right with God right now *or else.* In their interpretation of the End Times Israel is central to everything that will signal the Anti-Christ and the 1000 years of darkness will occur! In the Jewish Bible *Israel* refers to the Jewish People in covenant with their God, and in the New Testament it refers to the People of God which is anyone who's Christian who's soul is saved. The Evangelical Right has identified the State of Israel, which identifies itself as the nation of the Jewish People, as being their biblical Israel. 

So in a case of strange bed fellows many Evangelical Americans pushed for the US Government to become much more Pro-Israel and much more pro-active in supplying them weapons and regional support. They pushed really hard for about a decade for an American presidential candidate who was openly Pro-Christianity, Pro-""Family Values"", and importantly Pro-Israel. Haaaaaaaaaaaaave you met Ronald Reagan? The Reagan Administration leapt into partnering with Israel, even overlooking cases of Israeli espionage and industrial spying, treating it like another front in the global Cold War. 

Donald Trump is the inheritor of the American Political Right's need to promote Israel for their End of Days prophecies to come true. The Evangelical Right was an early and enthusiastic adopter of Donald J Trump because he made early and enthusiastic overtures to their leaders, who promoted him as The Man who was going to save the soul of America, right all of the wrongs, and who would stand up for their brand of Christianity in a forceful and open manner. I doubt Trump himself, as a private individual, has much regard or interest in Israel. He's reportedly called Jewish People who've worked for him (or who he's butted heads with) some remarkably un-politically correct nick names. Before his Presidency he had no great affinity with the Jewish community of New York as far as I can tell. 

But if he's to be the Defender of the Evangelical Christian Right and its cause, then promoting Israel and protecting it is of course what he's always been in favor of!",22,PoliticalDiscussion,"Why are American conservatives (Trump) so popular in Israel, whereas American Jews are predominantly Democrat?",https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/1nnpbbf/why_are_american_conservatives_trump_so_popular/,299,145

1nlal7x,"I would say that the unconstitutional part arose when the boat turned back to the direction it had come from ***and then*** was destroyed by U.S. weaponry. It is hard to argue that the boat was a threat to the United States when it was retreating and while it was *suspected* of being a narco boat that hadn't been established beyond reasonable doubt. Therefore the people on the boat were neither criminals nor enemy combatants but were murdered anyway.

If the government suspected that the boat was attempting to bring illegal materials into the United States, they should have sent humans to intercept. The drone could have tracked it's position until a boat or helicopter could intercept.

> Could Trump classify anyone a terrorist and send missiles after them?

I think that is a real concern considering that Trump has made statements to suggest that domestic groups that oppose him could be declared terrorists even if they don't engage in violence. Once someone is ""a terrorist"" the rules around use of violence and how much their constitutional rights need to be protected change significantly.",8,PoliticalDiscussion,Is using military force against suspected drug-trafficking boats constitutional or an overreach of presidential power?,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/1nlal7x/is_using_military_force_against_suspected/,133,275

Republicans complain about voter fraud and stolen elections but then try to do voter fraud and steal elections. Christians back Trump despite him being a horrible and immoral person. Conservatives back him despite him massively raising the deficit. Military people back him despite him saying soldiers who die are losers. Republicans as a whole seem to have given up on fair elections and democracy despite invading the Middle East 20 years ago to ""spread democracy"".

And that's without mentioning all the alternative facts, denialism, conspiracy theories, lies, misinformation etc that they're constantly putting out and believing. Don't get me started on flat earthers.

1bwbuka,"Why is “70% of people believe the country is going in the wrong direction” always used as a gotcha question to Harris?

Is it not clear that most of the country thinks that, but for opposite reasons? Conservatives thinking it’s going in the wrong direction because of immigration, trans people, social liberalism in general, etc. while liberals think it’s going in the wrong direction because of the supreme court’s bias and power, abortion restrictions, anti-trans laws, lack of gun control, etc. and a lot of people thinking corporations have too much power, wages aren’t fair enough, etc.

I don’t understand how that statement is supposed to prove anything when the country is so polarized and so many things are going on in different states in very different directions.

1nkroke,"Posts like this usually bring out the worst in the comments, so I don’t put much trust in them. That said, I think the bigger concern right now isn’t *who* the leader of the Democratic Party is, but how we fight back against the right wing — and we’re seeing that happen in a lot of ways.

On the national stage, leaders like Warren, Sanders, and Murphy are pushing back. At the state and regional level, people like Newsom, Pritzker, and Moore — along with countless Democratic mayors — are showing what real leadership looks like and setting examples for the rest of the country.

That’s what we need: strong voices at every level — national, statewide, and local — all working to protect our democracy. For me, the priority isn’t rallying behind one single “leader.” It’s recognizing that we already have a lot of leaders, and supporting all of them in this fight.",41,PoliticalDiscussion,Current Leaders Of The Democratic Party?,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/1nkroke/current_leaders_of_the_democratic_party/,78,203
1nkroke,"I'd say the Democrats appear leaderless.

Obviously this far from a presidential election, there's no White House contender, who would naturally become the leader of the party.

So what you have is the legislature, led by Hakeem Jeffries and Chuck Schumer, who appear to be hapless and feckless. I think there's a good chance Jeffries actually loses his seat to a primary challenger in the midterms (see, Eric Cantor).

There's Sanders, AOC and (to a much lesser extent) Crockett who are more in touch with the Democratic base but aren't in leadership roles, but actually seem to be willing to fight Trump in a way the actual leadership are squeamish of.

Finally, there's state governors. Newsom is the most obviously trying to step into a leadership role and getting the appropriate media coverage. Pritzker is the other obvious option - I think a lot of the reason Trump backed away from his ""confrontation"" with Chicago is feeding Pritzker a win that would give him a massive boost on the national stage.

But no-one is really there now, and that's part of the reason the Democratic party's popularity is so low. They might even do better by wheeling out Pelosi again, who could at least look like a leader.",44,PoliticalDiscussion,Current Leaders Of The Democratic Party?,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/1nkroke/current_leaders_of_the_democratic_party/,78,203
